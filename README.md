* This is a website project that I made for client who owns a car detailing company.
* The website is written in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and connect to a database using PHP.
* I learnt some much through building this website, as it was my first project for a client.
* I learnt how to embed google map on the site.
* The client was pleased was with the result as it would increase traffic towards his business and increased his business revenue.
* Am planning to make changes to the site to a web app with improved features, security and fast rendering and added features.
